Basically I really dislike how opinionated create-react-app is. This is a much smaller boilerplate that just has the bits needed to start development.

* It doesn't pick your unit test framework for you
* It doesn't hide your configuration files from you
* It doesn't set you up with a half-baked web-server running out of your file packer
* It doesn't assume you're creating a PWA.
* It doesn't assume you have a clue what a PWA is.
* It just installs the minimum possible config for babel, webpack and react
